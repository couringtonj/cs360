Mobile Application Development
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The requirements of the app were to provide a platform in which people could track their weight and set a goal weight. This app was made to address user needs such as goal weight and daily weight as well as login and create a new user.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
the need was for 3 screens, daily weight, goal weight and graph. I kept users in mind by making the app simple and straightforward. My design was ultimately not successful because I could not complete the app.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I approached the app by breaking it down into small chunnks and working on them individually. I used this technique. This can be applied in a multitude of ways to many different apps that are developed.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested the app by using the emulator and logcat to make sure the functions were working. It is important because it makes sure that your code is clean and that there are no mistakes, it revelaed that logcat is useful to make sure you are using the functions correctly. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I think my innovation came in the UI as I was able to use several layout managers and widgets to complete the project.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I found coding the app to be quite difficult using action handlers and databases as well.
